A native Android Application that allows credit card holders to use their cards during travel on the go without the hassle of having cards blocked due to using them at several different locations other than the card holder's usual locations. The app locates the GPS signal of the user on his cell phone and matches it with the location where the card was used to authorize the transaction.
